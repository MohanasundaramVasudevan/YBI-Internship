We began by preprocessing the data, including encoding categorical variables and scaling the features. The model's performance was evaluated using a confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score. A sample prediction was made to demonstrate the model's usage. This hands-on project illustrates the practical application of logistic regression in a real-world scenario to address customer churn prediction in the banking industry."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyPZl4d0nA5Qmq8X1mDqSb1O","name":"Project Outline.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
